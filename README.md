                       Tiny Template Library

A library of STL-inspired templates designed to work in conditions of
constrained resources, but also without RTTI, exceptions and corresponding
standard C++ library support.

Some templates are implementations of STL interfaces, some are not.

There is no allocator support and the O(log N) and similar complexity
guarantees might be not implemented.

The reverse iterators are usually not implemented yet.

Usually only equality operators are implemented, if any.

There is generally no streaming operator support. Nor is any planned.
